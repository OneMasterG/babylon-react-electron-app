# babylon-react-electron-app
boilerplate to create react+babylonjs apps that can also run inside electron

This is something I made over the weekend to see how babylonjs works with reactjs and electron.
At the time I released it, The Babylonjs team doesn't seem to have solid examples of this, just a few code snippets.

Hopefuly could be useful for others
